# Recipe Box API 

##### Epicodus Section: Java Week4 : Advanced Java Topics

### By Jessica Sheridan

## Description

All the recipe information you need at your fingertips:


For this week's independent project, you will create your very own API! Because you will build JavaScript apps that act as clients for APIs very soon, you are in the unique position to build an API backend server with Spark, then later build a client app in JavaScript or Android.

For this reason, you are tasked with creating an API that you have a personal interest in, so you can re-use it for later classes. Begin, as you have previously, by sketching out a data model and considering how your classes might stand in relationship to each other. Consider using abstract classes, inheritance, exceptions, filters, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships to structure your data model and your routes in a DRY and scalable way. How could someone break your API? How will you handle 404's? Consider these aspects as well.

Your project will be evaluated for it's completeness and thoughtfulness. Include a detailed, thoughtful readme that outlines the goal and capabilities of your API, and includes documentation of the endpoints and data that your APIreturns. Illustrate this with screenshots taken from Postman. Read through the documentation of several APIs to get a feel for which information you need to provide.
